🏦 Bank Management System (Mini Core Banking App)

 Project Description

The Bank Management System is a Java-based mini core banking application that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and fund transfer.

This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. It is designed as a console-based application for beginners and intermediate learners to understand how a simple banking system works.
